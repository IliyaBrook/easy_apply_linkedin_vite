# Easy Apply LinkedIn Chrome Extension

## Overview

**Easy Apply LinkedIn** is a Chrome extension designed to streamline the process of applying for jobs on LinkedIn. By automating the application process for Easy Apply jobs and organizing other applications, this tool saves time and enhances productivity for job seekers.

## What's new in 1.1
We improved the “External Apply” feature to store only unique job postings. Duplicates are now automatically removed based on the link and the combination of title + company name. This way, you’ll always see the latest and unique listings.

## Features

### 1. Popup Menu
- The main interface of the extension, accessible via the Chrome toolbar.
- Allows quick navigation to various pages and settings.

- Ensures no job opportunities are missed.

### 3. Filter Settings
- **Job Title Must Contain**: Filters jobs whose titles include specified keywords.

- **Job Title Must Skip**: Excludes jobs whose titles include specified keywords (takes priority over "Must Contain").

- **Job Text Content Bad Words**: Filters out jobs with unwanted keywords in the job description.

- Users can customize these filters for a more tailored job search.
